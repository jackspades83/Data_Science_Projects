Neural Networks & Deep Learning

Course 
Introduction to Neural Network and Deep Learning

The project was accomplished by delivering 4 sub-projects. Part 1,2 & 3 deploys a GUI powered by neural network to build a regressor & classifier respectively for a communications equipment manufacturer. The model predicts the equipment’s signal quality using various parameters from its products, which is responsible for emitting informative signals. Part 4 delivers an image classifier, which can classify numbers from the photographs captured at street level using a Neural Network”
